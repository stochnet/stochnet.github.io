- [Warmth](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Warmth)
- [Static Field](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Static_Field) 
- [Teleport](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Teleport_(Diablo_II))
- [Frozen Armor](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Frozen_Armor)
- all necessary passby skills

Add all remaining points to
- Static Field

**Remark**: Lightning has much higher damage at very low mana cost compared to Chain Lightning, however, the former can only attack enemies along the line of the lightning travels while the latter can jump to nearby enemies when travelling for area damage. It is more cost-effective to use Lightning more often than Chain Lightning. This requires a good positioning of the character when attacking a group of enemies. One should use Static Field a couple of times to reduce enemies' life before casting Lightning and Chain Lightning skills.

- Helm: [Griffon’s Eye](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Griffon%27s_Eye) for its +1 All Skills, +25% Faster Cast Rate, and –20% Enemy Lightning Resistance. Socket a lightning facet for an additional –5% Enemy Lightning Resistance. 
 
- Gloves: Rare gloves with good amounts of lightning, fire, and poison resistance. Additional strength, life, and mana are also qutie useful.  
 
- Belt: [Arachnid Mesh](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Arachnid_Mesh) for +1 All Skills and +20% Faster Cast Rate.
 
- Armor: [Skin of the Vipermagi](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Skin_of_the_Vipermagi) for +1 All Skills, +30% Faster Cast Rates, +35 All Resistance. Add one socket with one Lightning Facet for -5% Enemy Light Resistance. Can be upgraded for higher defense.

- Boots: Rare boots with Lightning, Fire, and Poison Resistances. Additional +30% Faster Run/Walk Speed and +10% Faster Hit Recovery are also beneficial. Poison Length Reduction and Half Freeze Duration are also useful attributes. 
 
- Weapon: Crystal Sword or Broad Sword with [Crescent Moon](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Crescent_Moon_Rune_Word) rune word for its –35% Enemy Lightning Resistance. This is a low-cost rune word weapon with huge enemy lightning resistance reduction. Alternative can be an orb with +3 lightning skills, +10% faster cast rate, +3 lightning and/or chain lightning, +3 lightning mastery, and two socketed lightning facets. However, this alternative is a lot more expensive than Crescent Moon with arguably a little higher damage.  
 
- Amulet: If using Crescent Moon as weapon, then equip a caster amulet with +2 All Sorceress Skills, +7% Faster Cast Rate (to reach a total of +117% Faster Cast Rate), and some resistance on Lightning, Fire, and Poison. Strength and life are also useful attributes. If using a sorceress orb with +10% Faster Cast Rate, then equip the [Mara's Kaleidoscope](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Mara%27s_Kaleidoscope_(Diablo_II)) for its +2 All Skills and +30 All Resistances.
 
- Switch Weapon and Shield: Crystal Sword or Flail with [Calls to Arms](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Call_to_Arms_Rune_Word) runeword to bump all skills by 1 and life/mana for 60%+, and Monarch shield with Spirit runeword to increase the skill levels on Call of the Arm. 
 
- Inventory: Sorceress Torch, Annihilus, Crack of the Heaven grand charm (the Lightning Sunder grand charm), 7 Lightning Skill grand charms with life or Faster Hit Recovery, All Resistance small charms with life or Faster Hit Recovery to make 65% Faster Hit Recovery, and max out Fire/Lightning/Poison resistances, and more life the better.


 
## Mercenary

Use Act II Mercenary with [Prayer Aura](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Prayer) and the following gears:
- Weapon: Ethereal Thresher/Giant Thresher/Great Poleaxe with [Infinity](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Infinity_Rune_Word) runeword for its [Conviction Aura](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Conviction).
- Helm: Ethereal helm with high defense and the [Cure](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Cure_Rune_Word) runeword for its level 1 [Cleansing Aura](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Cleansing) to reduce poison length,
- Armor: Ethereal armor with high defense with the [Chains of Honor](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Chains_of_Honor_Rune_Word) ruenword for boosting all resistance and life leech.

**Remark**: The combination of [Andariel’s Visage](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Andariel%27s_Visage_(Diablo_II)) and [Fortitude](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Rune_Word) runeword can be an alternative for high defense at the cost of losing the Cleansing Aura.
 
## Summary 
- Attack: Cast Static Field 2 to 3 times and then Lightning and Chain Lightning to clear out. This build has -65% enemy lightning resistance and needs +117% Faster Cast Rate.
- Survivability: The Fire, Light, and Poison resistances should be maxed out to 75%. The Cold resistance is at a high level over 30%.
- Supply: Mana should be generally enough by not using Chain Lightning too frequently. Life can be slowly regenerated by the combination of Prayer Aura and Cleansing Aura from the mercenary.
