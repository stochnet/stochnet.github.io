# Bow Amazon build

Bow Amazon build was one of the most classic and fun build in D2R. The damage of this build was greatly reduced, but it remains a very fun build to play and feels very different from other builds.

## Character stats

- Strength: Enough to wear all gears (particularly bow).
- Dexterity: All other points. This determines the damage of this build.
- Vitality: None.
- Energy: None.

## Skills

Add 20 points to each of the following skills:
- [Guided Arrow](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Guided_Arrow) (synergy skill to Multiple Shots and Strafe; mainly used against bosses).
- [Strafe](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Strafe_(Diablo_II)) (main attack when the enemies are scattered or aligned along lines for maximum arrow penetration effect).
- [Multiple Shot](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Multiple_Shot) (main attack, makes huge area damage and can reach enemies out of screen; reach level 14 first, then spend if more points are available).
- [Critical Strike](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Critical_Strike) (passive skill, increase critical hit chance).
- [Valkyrie](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Valkyrie) (summon Valkyrie to fight with you, can be used to attract enemies).
- [Magic Arrow](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Magic_Arrow) (used for enemies immune to physical attacks; only need to reach the level that no longer requires mana).
- [Pierce](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Pierce) (increase the chance that arrows pierce through enemies, only need to reach the level with +66% chance)
  
Add 1 point to each of the following skills:
- [Dodge](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Dodge_(Diablo_II)) (passive skill, increase chance of dodging melee attacks when standing still).
- [Avoid](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Avoid) (passive skill, increase chance of dodging ranged attacks when standing still; can spend more points if available).
- [Evade](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Evade) (passive skill, increase chance of dodging both melee and ranged attacks when moving).
- all necessary passby skills.
 
**Remarks**: 

1. Use Multiple Shot more often for large area damage. Only the middle third of the arrows have the additional bonus (like life/mana leech and curses). Needs to maximize increased attack speed (IAS) to reach fastest 7 frames (1 second = 25 frames) per attack.
2. Use Strafe when there are only few enemies scattering in the screen. An enemy can only be attacked once within 4 frames (even it appears that more than one arrow pass through an enemy). Better to use it when targets are a little scattered.
3. Magic arrow is purely magic and does not consume any real arrow. Effective against physical-immune enemies.
4. With the Razortail belt which provides +33% pierce chance, this build can easily reach 100% pierce chance when attacking.

## Gears
 
- Helm: Rare helm with +30% faster run/walk speed, +2 sockets with +15% IAS and +40% damage (or +30 maximum damage if not available), life or mana leech, add Strength or Dexterity, resistance. Adding Amazon skills is useful but not critical.

**Remarks**
1. Armor and Amulet combination: can also use an armor with +100 life and 4 socketed cold facets, which increase cold damage and reduce enemies cold resistance. Then change the amulet to one with +2 Sorceress Skills, +10% Faster Cast Rate, and some resistances, life, or strength.

2. +24 cold skill levels: +3 from weapon, +2 from helm, +2 from amulet, +2 from shield, +1 from belt, +2 from rings, +3 from Torch, +1 from Annihilus, +7 from skill charms, and +1 from Battle Order from Call to Arms.

## Summary 
- Attack: Cast one Frozon Orb and several Glacial Spikes alternately. These two skills at 44+ levels and sufficient reduction of enemies' cold resistance at +105% Faster Cast Rate make huge damage.

- Supply: Mana can be regenerated quickly due to the Meditation Aura. The life can be slowly regenerated by the combination of Prayer Aura, Meditation Aura and Cleansing Aura from the mercenary.
