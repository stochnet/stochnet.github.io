# Bow Amazon build

Bow Amazon build was one of the most classic and fun builds in D2R. The damage of this build was greatly reduced, but it remains a very fun build to play and feels very different from other builds.

## Character stats

- Strength: Enough to wear all gears (particularly bow).
- Dexterity: All other points. This determines the damage of this build.
- Vitality: None.
- Energy: None.

## Skills

Add 20 points to each of the following skills:
- [Guided Arrow](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Guided_Arrow) (synergy skill to Multiple Shots and Strafe; mainly used against bosses).
- [Strafe](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Strafe_(Diablo_II)) (main attack when the enemies are scattered or aligned along lines for maximum arrow penetration effect).
- [Multiple Shot](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Multiple_Shot) (main attack, makes huge area damage and can reach enemies out of screen; reach level 14 first, then more if spare skill points are available).
- [Critical Strike](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Critical_Strike) (passive skill, increase critical hit chance).
- [Valkyrie](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Valkyrie) (summon Valkyrie to fight with you, can be used to attract enemies).
- [Magic Arrow](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Magic_Arrow) (used for enemies immune to physical attacks; only need to reach the level 13 after gearing so that it no longer requires mana ).
- [Pierce](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Pierce) (increase the chance that arrows pierce through enemies, only need to reach the level 8 or 9 after gearing for +66% chance).
  
Add 1 point to each of the following skills:
- [Dodge](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Dodge_(Diablo_II)) (passive skill, increase chance of dodging melee attacks when standing still).
- [Avoid](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Avoid) (passive skill, increase chance of dodging ranged attacks when standing still; can spend more points if available).
- [Evade](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Evade) (passive skill, increase chance of dodging both melee and ranged attacks when moving).
- all necessary passby skills.
 
**Remarks**: 

1. Use Multiple Shot more often for large area damage. Only the middle third of the arrows have the additional bonus (like life/mana leech and curses). Needs to maximize increased attack speed (IAS) to reach fastest 7 frames (1 second = 25 frames) per shot.
2. Use Strafe when there are only few enemies scattering in the screen. An enemy can only be attacked once within 4 frames (even it appears that more than one arrow pass through an enemy). Better to use it when targets are a little scattered.
3. Magic arrow is purely magic and does not consume any real arrow. Effective against physical-immune enemies.
4. With the Razortail belt which provides +33% pierce chance, this build can easily reach 100% pierce chance when attacking.

- Helm: Rare helm with +30% faster run/walk speed, +2 sockets with +15% IAS and +40% damage (or +30 maximum damage if not available) per socket, life or mana leech, add Strength or Dexterity, resistance. Adding Amazon skills is useful but not critical.

- Inventory: Amazon Torch, Annihilus, grand charms and small charms with maximum damage, life, faster run/walk, and resistance.

**Remarks**
1. Faith Grand Matron Bow versus [Windforce](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Windforce_(Diablo_II)): While Windforce has higher maximum damage and faster attack speed, it requires an Act I mecenary to wield Faith runeword for the Fanaticism Aura. However the the increased damage attribute of this aura has only half of the effect on Amazon as an ally. Moreover, Act I mecenaries do not provide any other aura, and they freqently run away from the Amazon such that the latter is out of the range of the Fanaticism aura. Overall it is better that the Amazon holds the Faith by herself.

2. Grand Matron Bow has high damage but slow attack speed. Although Fanaticism aura provides IAS, the gloves Laying of Hands provide +20% IAS, the Amazon still needs another +75% IAS (a total of 95% IAS in addition to level 15 Fanaticism) to reach the breakpoint of the fastest attack speed (7 frames per shot). Therefore, the build needs 5 IAS jewels socketed on her gears in total. An armor can provide 4 sockets and a rare helm can provide up to 2 sockets (a magic helm can provide 3, but lack lots of attributes and hence is worse than a 2-socket rare helm).

3. The damage of this build depends on the minimum and maximum damages. Therefore, the goal is to maximize them. This is the reason of choosing the gloves, boots, and ring mentioned above.

4. In an 8-player game, monsters have 450% life of their normal life in a 1-player game (the monsters have 50% more life for every additional player in game, up to 350% more life due to the other 7 players). The Atma's Scarab is very useful as it has a 5% chance to spell level 2 Amplify Damage curse on enemies. Although the chance and level are low, the effect of reducing 100% physical resistance on enemies is very significant: most monsters in Hell Difficulty have +50% physical resistance; and that becomes -50% once Amplify Damage is applied, making the damage of the Amazon 3 times than before. This is essential for the Amazon to kill fast in a many-player game. With her very high IAS, the Amazon has a good chance to triger Amplify Damage, such as by using Strafe.

5. It is necessary to have a good amount of resistance (especially fire and lightning) and life. After casting Battle Order from Call to Arms, the Amazon should have at least 1000 hit points so that she won't die easily.

6. With sufficient amount of life and mana leech (at least +5% on each), the Amazon can quickly gerenate life and mana in conflicts. The leeching does not apply to skeleton and works poorly for physcial-immune enemies, so use Magic Arrow in these cases.

7. Since this build cannot teleport, it is very helpful to have fast running. Amazons run fast already, but an additional 100% faster run/walk can make them move very fast. This is better than wearing an Enigma for its Teleport, since Amazons' cast rate is very low and Enigma does not increase physical damage.

8. Fortitude as armor: While Fortitude is an excellent armor for the huge bonus to damage, defense, and resistance, it does not provide any IAS.

9. Raven Frost is a must for this build which prevents the Amazon from being slowed down (in both attack and move speed) by cold damage. For enemies with [Holy Freeze aura](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Holy_Freeze) or [Decrepify](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Decrepify), kill them first to get rid of those negative effects.

10. The actual damage on a target is uniformly drawn between the minimum and maximum damages made by the Amazon. While the average is the same by increasing the same amount of minimum or maximum damages, smaller gap between them makes smaller variance and is more effective in real battles (large gap often results in some enemies being killed fast and some slow, requiring more shots in total).
 
## Mercenary

Use Act II Mercenary with [Might](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Might) and the following gears:
- Weapon: Ethereal Thresher/Giant Thresher/Great Poleaxe with [Pride](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Pride_Rune_Word) runeword for its level 20 [Concentration Aura](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Concentration).
- Helm: Ethereal [Andarielâ€™s Visage](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Andariel%27s_Visage_(Diablo_II)) for its added strength (to wear a Sacred Armor) and life leech.
- Armor: Ethereal Scared Armor with [Fortitude](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Rune_Word) runeword for high defense and resistance.

 
## Summary 
- Attack: Frequently use Multiple Shot for large area damage and Strafe for scattered enemies. Use Guided Arrow against bosses. Use Magic Arrow against enemies immune to physical damages or cannot be leeched (like skeleton).
- Survivability: The Fire, Light, and Poison resistances should be maxed out to 75%. Can recover life by life leech.
- Supply: Can recover mana quickly by mana leech.
