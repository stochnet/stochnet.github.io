# Fist and Hammer Paladin build

Fist and Hammer Paladin is a great magic finder that can easily farm everywhere solo in 8-player games.

## Character stats

- Strength: None.
- Dexterity: To reach 75% chance to block when Holy Shield is on.
- Vitality: All other points.
- Energy: None.

## Skills

Add 20 points to each of the following skills:

- [Blessed Hammer](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Pierce) (main attack skill).
- [Fist of the Heavens](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Fist_of_the_Heavens_(Diablo_II)) (second main attack skill)
- [Vigor](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Vigor) (synergy skill to Blessed Hammer: +14% magic damage per level).
- [Blessed Aim](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Blessed_Aim) (synergy skill to Blessed Hammer: +14% magic damage per level).
- [Concentration](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Concentration) (synergy skill to Blessed Hammer: +50% of efficiency damage increase).
- [Holy Bolt](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Holy_Bolt) (synergy skill to Fist of the Heavens: +15% Holy Bolt damage per level; if Fist of the Heavens is used much more than Blessed Hammer, then maximize this instead of Concentration).


Add 1 point to each of the following skills:
- all necessary passby skills.


**Remarks**: 

1. Fist of the Heavens (FOTH) is very effective against large groups of demons and undead, since every shot blows one Holy Bolt towards every enemy in the screen and can pass through it to hit those behind. Therefore, each enemy may get hit by multiple Holy Bolts. FOTH has cooldown and thus does not benefit from faster cast rate. However, the cooldown is only 0.4 second (about 10 frames). FOTH cannot attack animals such as cows. Switch to Blessed Hammer for such enemies.

2. Blessed Hammer (BH) is very powerful against all enemies except those immune to magic, which are very limited in D2R. Switch to FOTH (for groups of targets) or Holy Bolts (for single targets) for magic-immune enemies. Blessed Hammer needs 125% faster cast rate. A hammer starts from 9 clock position of the Paladin and spirals clockwise for 2.5 circles with gradually increasing radius. If the Paladin wants to hit a nearby enemy (such as act boss), he should usually stand at 6 clock location of the enemy (right on the south side of the enemy).

3. Holy Bolt is effective against single non-animal targets. It can also heal allies when hitting them.

4. Keep Concentration Aura on when using Blessed Hammer for maximum efficiency: the chance that Blessed Hammer hits enemies, despite it visually does or not, is affected by the level of Concentration. 

5. Use Vigor in town for fast running.
