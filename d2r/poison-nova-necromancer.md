# Poison Nova Necromancer build

Poison Nova Necromancer is a special spell-and-run build that can solo everywhere in 8-player games.

## Character stats

- Strength: None.
- Dexterity: None.
- Vitality: All points.
- Energy: None.

## Skills

Add 20 points to each of the following skills:

- [Poison Nova](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Poison_Nova) (main attack skill)
- [Poison Dagger](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Poison_Dagger) (synergy skill to Poison Nova).
- [Poison Explosion](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Poison_Explosion) (synergy skill to Poison Nova).
- [Corpse Explosion](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Vigor) (main attack skill).


Add 1 point to each of the following skills:

- [Revive](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Revive) (revives distract enemies).
- [Skeleton Mastery](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Skeleton_Mastery) (improve revives' life and defense).
- [Iron Golem](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Golem) (raise a golem to distract enemies).
- [Golem Mastery](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Golem_Mastery) (increase golem's life).
- [Lower Resist](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Lower_Resist) (assistant skill to lower enemies' poison resistance).
- all necessary passby skills.



**Remarks**: 

1. In battles, spell Lower Resist (it has very large effect range) on enemies to reduce their resistance to poison, spell Poison Nova to hit everyone and then teleport away. No need to wait if it is a low-player game. It may take a few seconds for them to die.

2. If one Poison Nova is not enough, keep teleporting around the enemies and spell Poisson Nova once in a while. Keep the Necromancer safe by using the revives and golem.

3. Use Corpse Explosion to help the killings. However, in 8-player games, Corpse Explosion is not very effective as it only makes damage equal to the corpse life in 1-player game (100%) while the enemies have 450% of their life now.

4. Can use Iron Golem converted from a poleaxe with Insight runeword. In this case, invest some skill points to Golem Mastery to increase its life or it can die frequently.

## Gears

## Mercenary

Use Act II Mercenary with [Prayer Aura](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Prayer) and the following gears:
- Weapon: Ethereal Thresher/Giant Thresher/Great Poleaxe with [Insight](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Insight_Rune_Word) runeword for its [Meditation](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Meditation).
- Helm: Ethereal helm with high defense and the [Cure](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Cure_Rune_Word) runeword for its level 1 [Cleansing Aura](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Cleansing) to reduce poison length and curse duration.
- Armor: Ethereal armor with high defense with the [Chains of Honor](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Chains_of_Honor_Rune_Word) ruenword for boosting all resistance and life leech.

**Remarks**

If having an Iron Golem converted from Insight runeword, then one can hire an Act III Mecenary with Lightning specialty and the following gears:

- Helm: Griffon's Eye for its +1 all skills, +25% faster cast rate, -25% enemy lightning resistance and +20% lightning damage with a socketed lightning facet.
- Weapon: Crystal Sword or Broad Sword with Crescent Moon runeword for its -35% enemy lightning resistance.
- Shield: Ethereal Monach shield with Spirit runeword for its +2 all skills, +35% faster cast rate, and resistances. Mecenaries cannot block so it is unnecessary to equip the Jewlerer's Monarch of Reflection with 4 lightning facets. A standard monarch shield with 4 lightning facets is fine but it is more expensive and loses some range of Static Field.
- Armor: Skin of the Vipermagi for its +1 all skills, +30% faster cast rate, and +35 all resistances. Add a socket with lightning facet.

Although this mecenary does not provide any aura, he can spell Static Field which can effectively reduce enemies' life. Hence the gears should be mostly on increasing skill level and reducing enemy lightning resistance.

## Summary 
- Attack: Use Lower Resist curse and multiple Poisson Nova to kill enemies. May use Corpse Explosion to help the killings. Raise Iron Golem and revives to distract enemies and keep the Necromancer safe.
- Survivability: All resistances should reach 75%. 
- Supply: Mana can be regenerated quickly due to the Meditation Aura from the mercenary (or Iron Golem). Life can be slowly regenerated by the combination of Prayer Aura, Cleansing Aura, and Meditation Aura from the mercenary.
