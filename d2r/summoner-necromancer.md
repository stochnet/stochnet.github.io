# Summoner Necromancer build

Summoner Necromancer is a safe build that can run everywhere solo (but often slowly) in 8-player games.

## Character stats

- Strength: None.
- Dexterity: None.
- Vitality: All other points.
- Energy: None.

## Skills

Add 20 points to each of the following skills:

- [Raise Skeleton](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Raise_Skeleton) (increase the number of skeletons and their damage/life/defense/attack rating). 
- [Skeleton Mastery](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Skeleton_Mastery) (increase the life and damge of skeletons and revives).
- [Golem Mastery](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Golem_Mastery) (increase life and speed of golem).
- [Corpse Explosion](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Vigor) (main attack skill; help the skeletons and revived to kill faster).


Add 1 point to each of the following skills:

- [Lower Resist](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Lower_Resist) ([Amplify Damage](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Amplify_Damage) is the most frequently used curse).
- [Iron Golem](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Golem) (convert Insight runeword to supply mana).
- [Revive](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Revive) (summon revives to fight together with skeletons).
- [Summon Resist](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Summon_Resist) (increase resistances of skeletons, golem, and revives).
- all necessary passby skills.


**Remarks**: 

1. At the beginning of a game, summon skeletons from the corpses in the Nihlathak's Temple (The NPC Anya in Act V town will open it for you once you completed the quest to save her from the Frozen River).

2. The Necromancer is very safe behind all the skeletons, golem, and revives.

3. Use Corpse Explosion to help the killings. However, in 8-player games, Corpse Explosion is not very effective as it only makes damage equal to the corpse life in 1-player game (100%) while the enemies have 450% of their life now.

4. Can use Iron Golem converted from a poleaxe with Insight runeword. In this case, invest some skill points to Golem Mastery to increase its life.

- Survivability: All resistances should reach 75%. 
- Supply: Mana can be regenerated quickly due to the Meditation Aura from the Iron Golem. Life can be slowly regenerated by the combination of Cleansing Aura from the mercenary.
