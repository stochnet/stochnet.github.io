# Lightning Javelin Amazon build

Lightning Javelin Amazon (Javazon for short hereafter) is a well-known for her incredibly high area damage. More details about the pros and cons of this build will be given below.

## Character stats

- Strength: A total of 156 with all gears/charms to wield the Monarch shield with Spirit runeword.
- Dexterity: A total of 151 with all gears/charms to wield [Thunderstroke](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Thunderstroke) javelin.
- Vitality: All other points.
- Energy: None.

## Skills

Add 20 points to each of the following skills:
- [Lightning Fury](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Lightning_Fury) (main attack; makes huge area damage, particularly against crowds).
- [Power Strike](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Strike) (synergy skill to Lightning Fury).
- [Lightning Bolt](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Lightning_Bolt) (synergy skill to Lightning Fury).
- [Charged Strike](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Charged_Strike) (synergy skill to Lightning Fury; also extremely powerful melee attack itself; very effecitve against bosses).
- [Lightning Strike](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Lightning_Strike) (synergy skill to Lightning Fury).

Add 1 point to each of the following skills:
- [Dodge](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Dodge_(Diablo_II)) (passive skill, increase chance of dodging melee attacks when standing still).
- [Avoid](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Avoid) (passive skill, increase chance of dodging ranged attacks when standing still; can spend more points if available).
- [Evade](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Evade) (passive skill, increase chance of dodging both melee and ranged attacks when moving).
- [Pierce](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Pierce) (increase the chance that arrows pierce through enemies, only need to reach the level with +66% chance)
- all necessary passby skills.


**Remarks**: 

1. Lightning Fury is the main attack with large area damage and hence particualrly effective against large crowds, such as cows). When a thrown javelin hits a target, it splits as mutiple lightnings to nearby enemies, and they can further split to more lightnings. Also because of this, Lightning Fury is not very effective in the case where only few enemies present.
  
2. Pierce is useful to increase the number of lightnings and hence high pierce chance.

3. Charged Strike has very high damage on single target and can often kill act bosses in a second even in 8-player games.

**Remarks**

1. +24 javelin skill levels: +1 from helm, +1 from amulet, +2 from armor, +2 from shield, +4 from weapon, +2 from gloves, +3 from Torch, +1 from Annihilus, +7 from skill charms, and +1 from Battle Command on Call to Arms.
2. -40% enemy lightning resistance: -25% from helm, -15% from weapon.
3. +40% increased attack speed: +20% from gloves, +20% from amulet.
4. +68% faster cast rate: +25% from helm, +35% from shield, +10% from ring.
5. Thunderstroke versus [Titan's Revenge](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Titan%27s_Revenge): Titan's Revenge is a usual choice for Javelin Amazon, with a major reason due to its greater quantity and self-replenish. However, Thunderstroke becomes better now since its quantity is increased, plus its reduction on enemy lightning resistance and increased attack speed.
6. Amulet and ring combination: Can also use [Bul-Kathos' Wedding Band](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Bul-Kathos'_Wedding_Band) for +1 All Skills and 5% life leech. This requires using a caster amulet for 8% faster cast rate (but this loses 20% increased attack speed from Highlord's Wrath). Since faster cast rate is only to slightly increase the Amazon's movement speed rather than her attack speed, Thunderstroke is better for increasing damage.

8. Jewelers Monarch of Deflecting: 4 sockets with lightning facets (hence -20% enemy lightning resistance and +20% lightning damage), 30% faster block rate, and 20% increased chance of blocking. It provides more reduction on enemy lightning resistance. However, it requires more stat points in dexterity to reach the ideal 75% blocking rate, and needs mana and resistance from other gears and charms.

 
## Mercenary

Use Act II Mercenary with [Might](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Might) and the following gears:
- Weapon: Ethereal Thresher/Giant Thresher/Great Poleaxe with [Infinity](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Infinity_Rune_Word) runeword for its [Conviction Aura](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Conviction).
- Helm: Ethereal helm with high defense and the [Cure](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Cure_Rune_Word) runeword for its level 1 [Cleansing Aura](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Cleansing) to reduce poison length and curse duration.
- Armor: Ethereal armor with high defense with the [Chains of Honor](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Chains_of_Honor_Rune_Word) ruenword for boosting all resistance and life leech.

**Remark**: The combination of [Andariel’s Visage](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Andariel%27s_Visage_(Diablo_II)) and [Fortitude](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Rune_Word) runeword can be an alternative for high defense at the cost of losing the Cleansing Aura.
 
## Summary 
- Attack: Use Lightning Fury for large crowds and Charged Strike to melee single targets.
- Survivability: The Fire, Light, and Poison resistances should be maxed out to 75%. The Cold resistance is at a high level over 30%. Life leech can help recovering life.
- Supply: Need enough maximum mana, mana leech and +mana after kills to keep mana up.
