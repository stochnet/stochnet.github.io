# Trap Assassin build

This is a build relying on summoned traps to kill enemeis. She can sole everywhere at a bit slower pace in 8-player games.

## Character stats

- Strength: None.
- Dexterity: To a proper level for good blocking rate.
- Vitality: All other points.
- Energy: None.

## Skills

Add 20 points to each of the following skills:

- [Lightning Sentry](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Lightning_Sentry) (main attack).
- [Death Sentry](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Sentry) (synergy skill to Lightning Sentry; can also work well in games with small amount of players).
- [Charged Bolt Sentry](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Charged_Bolt_Sentry) (synergy skill to Lightning Sentry).
- [Shock Web](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Shock_Web) (synergy skill to Lightning Sentry; can also help killing).
- [Fire Blast](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_Blast) (synergy skill to Death Sentry; can also help killing; makes small area damage).

Add 1 point to each of the following skills:

- [Fade](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Fade) (increase all resistance, reduce physical damage, reduce curse duration).
- [Mind Blast](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Mind_Blast) (temporarily control enemies).
- all necessary passby skills.

**Remarks**: 

1. Place up to 5 Lightning Sentries during a conflict, then wait and let them kill the enemies. It is quite safe in this regard as the Assassin can hide behind, particularly no need to confront the Souls and Dolls face to face.
2. Can spell Fire Blast and Shock Web to help the killings.
3. Death Sentry can spell Corpse Explosion but it is not effective in games with many players.

 
## Gears

- Gloves: [Death's Hand](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Death%27s_Hand) for its +50% Poison Resistance and -75% Poison Length Reduction. With the set belt, it also has 30% increased attack speed which increase the trap placement speed.

- Boots: Rare Boots with Lightning, Fire, and Poison Resistances. Additional +30% Faster Run/Walk Speed and +10% Faster Hit Recovery are also beneficial. Poison Length Reduction and Half Freeze Duration are also useful attributes. 
 
- Amulet: Caster amulet with +2 Assassin Skills, +17% Faster Cast Rate, some resistance on Lightning (more important than other elements), Fire, and Poison. 
 
- Switch Weapon and Shield: Crystal Sword or Flail with [Calls to Arms](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Call_to_Arms_Rune_Word) runeword to bump all skills by 1 and life/mana for 60%+, and Monarch shield with Spirit runeword to increase the skill levels on Call of the Arm. 
 
- Inventory: Assassin Torch, Annihilus, Crack of the Heaven grand charm (the Lightning Sunder grand charm), 7 Traps grand charms with life or Faster Hit Recovery, All Resistance small charms with life or Faster Hit Recovery, and max out Fire/Lightning/Poison resistances, and more life the better. 

**Remarks**

1. +19 Martial Arts skills: 1 from helm, 2 from amulet, 2 from armor, 2 from ring, 3 from Torch, 1 from Annihilus, 7 from skill grand charms, and 1 from Battle Command on Call to Arms.

2. -80% enemy lightning resistance: -25% from helm, -35% from weapon, -20% from shield.

3. +40% lightning damage: +20% from helm, +20% from shield.

4. +42% faster cast rate: +25% from helm and +17% from amulet. This reaches 12 frames per cast. This only affects the cast rate of Teleport. The next breakpoint is 65% faster cast rate giving 11 frames per cast.

5. +50% increase attack speed: +30% from gloves, +20% from weapon. This build needs 42% increased attack speed to reach a breakpoint when using Phase Blade with Crescent Moon runeword. The runeword already provides 20%, the gloves and belt of the Death's set can provide 30%.

## Mercenary

Use Act II Mercenary with [Prayer](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Prayer) and the following gears:
- Weapon: Ethereal Thresher/Giant Thresher/Great Poleaxe with [Insight](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Insight_Rune_Word) runeword for its [Meditation Aura](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Meditation).
- Helm: Ethereal helm with high defense and the [Cure](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Cure_Rune_Word) runeword for its level 1 [Cleansing Aura](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Cleansing) to reduce poison length and curse duration.
- Armor: Ethereal armor with high defense with the [Chains of Honor](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Chains_of_Honor_Rune_Word) ruenword for boosting all resistance and life leech.

**Remark** Can also use Infinity runeword. While it provides more reduction on enemy lightning resistance, this has some drawbacks: the traps are usually placed far away where the Conviction aura from the mercenary cannot cover; May lack enough mana regeneration due to the loss of Meditation aura from Insight runeword; Insight together with Prayer and Cleansing auras provide more life regeneration. 

## Summary 
- Attack: Lightning Sentry has fairly high damage particularly with the high enemy lightning resistance reduction.
- Survivability: The Fire, Light, and Poison resistances can be easily maxed using Fade. 
- Supply: Mana can be quickly recovered by the Meditation aura from the mecenary, and life can recover due to the Prayer, Meditation, and Cleasing auras from the mecenary.
