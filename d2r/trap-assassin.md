# Trap Assassin build

This is a build relying on summoned traps to kill enemeis. She can sole everywhere at a bit slower pace in 8-player games.

## Character stats

- Strength: None.
- Dexterity: To a proper level for good blocking rate.
- Vitality: All other points.
- Energy: None.

## Skills

Add 20 points to each of the following skills:

- [Lightning Sentry](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Lightning_Sentry) (main attack).
- [Death Sentry](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Sentry) (synergy skill to Lightning Sentry; can also work well in games with only few players).
- [Charged Bolt Sentry](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Charged_Bolt_Sentry) (synergy skill to Lightning Sentry).
- [Shock Web](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Shock_Web) (synergy skill to Lightning Sentry).
- [Fire Blast](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_Blast) (synergy skill to Death Sentry).

Add 1 point to each of the following skills:

- [Fade](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Fade) (increase all resistance, reduce physical damage, reduce curse duration).
- [Mind Blast](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Mind_Blast) (temporarily control enemies).
- all necessary passby skills.

**Remarks**: 

1. Place up to 5 Lightning Sentries during a conflict, then wait and let them kill the enemies. It is quite safe in this regard as the Assassin can hide behind, particularly no need to confront the Souls and Dolls face to face.
2. Can throw Fire Blast to help the killings.
3. Death Sentry can spell Corpse Explosion but it is not effective in games with many players.
