## Gears
 
- Shield: Monarch shield base with [Phoenix](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Phoenix_Rune_Word) runeword with level 15 [Redemption Aura](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Redemption) for life and mana regeneration from enemy corpses; -28% enemy fire resistance greatly increase fire damages of this build; +10% maximum fire resistance and +5% maximum lightning resistance increase the maximum resistances to these two types of damages.

- Gloves: [Magefist](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Magefist_(Diablo_II)) for its +1 Fire Skills and +20% Faster Cast Rate.  
 
- Belt: [Arachnid Mesh](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Arachnid_Mesh) for +1 All Skills and +20% Faster Cast Rate.
 
- Armor: [Skin of the Vipermagi](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Skin_of_the_Vipermagi) for +1 All Skills, +30% Faster Cast Rates, +35 All Resistance. Add one socket with one Lightning Facet for -5% Enemy Light Resistance. Can be upgraded for higher defense.

Strength and life are also useful attributes. If using the Eschuta’s Temper as weapon, which has 40% Faster Cast Rate, then equip [Mara's Kaleidoscope](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Mara%27s_Kaleidoscope_(Diablo_II)) for its +2 All Skills and +30 All Resistances.

- Weapon: Ethereal Thresher/Giant Thresher/Great Poleaxe with [Infinity](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Infinity_Rune_Word) runeword for its [Conviction Aura](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Conviction).
- Helm: Ethereal helm with high defense and the [Cure](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Cure_Rune_Word) runeword for its level 1 [Cleansing Aura](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Cleansing) to reduce poison length,

**Remark**: The combination of [Andariel’s Visage](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Andariel%27s_Visage_(Diablo_II)) and [Fortitude](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Rune_Word) runeword can be an alternative for high defense at the cost of losing the Cleansing Aura.
 

## Summary 

- Attack: the high-level (43+) Fire Ball and Hydra make huge damage to enemies with skill grand charms. This build has -58% enemy fire resistance and needs +105% Faster Cast Rate. The Hydra skill is great for scouting and killing extremely dangerous enemies from distance. The Meteor skill is an assistant skill for extra damages, but it requires cooldown and takes long time to get the meteors fall, and hence it is not quite useful in real battles. The Static Field skill can reduce lives of enemies with low lightning resistance, but it works in a much smaller range as not many lightning skills are added from gears for Fire Sorceress.  
 
- Survivability: The Fire, Light, and Poison resistances should be maxed out, particularly at 90%, 80%, and 75%, respectively. The Cold resistance is at a high level over 30%.
 
- Supply: The Redemption Aura constantly consumes bodies of killed enemies for life and mana generation.
