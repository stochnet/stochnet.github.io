# Cold Sorceress build

Cold Sorceress build is often used in early to mid game for the low gear cost and high magic find rate. With the cold sunder charm, this build can also perform well for late game now. However, unlike commonly recommended Blizzard and Frozen Orb builds, the build here mainly casts Glacial Spike and is more powerful and versatile.

## Character stats

- Strength: A total of 156 with all gears/charms to weild the Monarch shield with Spirit runeword
- Dexterity: None
- Vitality: All other points
- Energy: None

## Skills

Add 20 points to each of the following skills:
- [Ice Bolt](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Ice_Bolt) (synergy skill to increase the damage of Glacial Spike and Frozen Orb).
- [Ice Blast](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Ice_Blast) (synergy skill to increase the damage of Glacial Spike).
- [Glacial Spike](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Glacial_Spike) (main attack skill, makes area damage; freeze non-boss enemies and slow bosses).
- [Frozen Orb](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Frozen_Orb) (main attack skill but needs cooldown, so cast Gacial Spike during cooldowns).
- [Cold Mastery](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Cold_Mastery) (reduce enemies' cold resistance, still worth being maximized despite its effect is reduced to 1/5 for cold immune enemies).

Add 1 point to each of the following skills:
- [Warmth](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Warmth) (increase mana regeneration).
- [Static Field](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Static_Field) (reduce life of enemies not immune to lightning).
- [Teleport](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Teleport_(Diablo_II)) (fast movement).
- [Frozen Armor](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Frozen_Armor) (increase defense).
- all necessary passby skills.
 
**Remark**: Cast Glacial Spike and Frozen Orb alternately (the latter has cooldown) can make huge damage to enemies. Need to pay attention and make sure to cast Frozen Orb as soon as its cooldown is over.
