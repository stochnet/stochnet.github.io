# Cold Sorceress build

Cold Sorceress build is often used in early to mid game for the low gear cost and high magic find rate. With the cold sunder charm, this build can also perform well for late game now. However, unlike commonly recommended Blizzard and Frozen Orb builds, the build here mainly casts Glacial Spike and is more powerful and versatile.

## Character stats

## Summary 
- Attack: Cast one Frozon Orb and several Glacial Spikes alternately. These two skills at 43+ levels and sufficient reduction of enemies' cold resistance at +105% Faster Cast Rate make huge damage. This build does not require Infinity runeword, and the key gears such as Death's Phantom, Nightwing's Veil, and Ormus' Robes are relatively cheap to obtain in late game. 
- Survivability: The Fire, Light, and Poison resistances should be maxed out to 75%. The Cold resistance is at a high level over 30%.
- Supply: Mana can be regenerated quickly with the Meditation Aura. The life can be slowly regenerated by the combination of Prayer Aura, Meditation Aura and Cleansing Aura from the mercenary.
