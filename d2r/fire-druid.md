- Survivability: The Fire, Light, and Poison resistances should be maxed out, particularly at 90%, 80%, and 75%, respectively. The life is significantly boosted by Oak Sage but make sure to regenerate it once it gets killed.
 
- Supply: The Redemption Aura constantly consumes bodies of killed enemies for life and mana generation.
