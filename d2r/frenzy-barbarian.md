- Switch Weapon and Shield: Crystal Sword or Flail with [Call to Arms](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Call_to_Arms_Rune_Word) runeword, and Heart of the Oak runeword to add 3 skill levels to Call to Arms. 

- Inventory: Barbarian Torch, Annihilus, grand charms and small charms with maximum damage, life, and resistance.

**Remarks**
1. Grief versus [Breath of the Dying](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Breath_of_the_Dying_Rune_Word): they appear to be similar but the high attack speed on Grief is usually preferred.

2. The damage of this build depends on the minimum and maximum damages. Therefore, the goal is to maximize them. This is the reason of choosing the gloves, armor, and ring mentioned above.

3. In an 8-player game, monsters have 450% life of their normal life in a 1-player game (the monsters have 50% more life for every additional player in game, up to 350% more life due to the other 7 players). The Atma's Scarab is very useful as it has a 5% chance to spell level 2 Amplify Damage curse on enemies. Although the chance and level are low, the effect of reducing 100% physical resistance on enemies is very significant: most monsters in Hell Difficulty have +50% physical resistance; and that becomes -50% once Amplify Damage is applied, making the damage of the Amazon 3 times than before. This is essential for the Amazon to kill fast in a many-player game. With her very high IAS, the Amazon has a good chance to triger Amplify Damage, such as by using Strafe.

4. With sufficient amount of life (20% or more) and mana leech (+5% or more), the Barbarian can quickly gerenate life and mana in conflicts. The leeching does not apply to skeleton and works poorly for physcial-immune enemies, so use Berserker in these cases.

7. Since this build cannot teleport, it is very helpful to have fast running. Frenzy can greatly increase the running speed of the Barbarian and it lasts about 6 seconds and is refreshed when used on an enemy again.

8. Fortitude is undoubtly the best armor that increase both damage, defense, and resistances of the Barbarian.

9. Instead of using Raven Frost, which does not provide much benefit to damage, life/mana leech, and resistance, we choose to socket Cham to get the Cannot Be Frozen attribute.

 
## Mercenary

Use Act II Mercenary with [Might](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Might) and the following gears:
- Weapon: Ethereal Thresher/Giant Thresher/Great Poleaxe with [Pride](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Pride_Rune_Word) runeword for its level 20 [Concentration Aura](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Concentration).
- Helm: Ethereal [Andarielâ€™s Visage](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Andariel%27s_Visage_(Diablo_II)) for its added strength (to wear a Sacred Armor) and life leech.
- Armor: Ethereal Scared Armor with [Fortitude](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Rune_Word) runeword for high defense and resistance.

**Remarks**

1. Pride is better than the Reaper's Toll since the mecenary runs much slower than the Barbarian and cannot triger the Decrepify curse fast enough. Therefore it is better to equip the Atma's Scarab by himself.
2. Cure is not very useful since Frenzy makes the Barbarian attack and run fast even under Decrepify curse, and the Barbarian has enough life leech to recover life quickly.
## Summary 
- Attack: Frequently use Multiple Shot for large area damage and Strafe for scattered enemies. Use Guided Arrow against bosses. Use Magic Arrow against enemies immune to physical damages or cannot be leeched (like skeleton).
- Survivability: The Fire, Light, and Poison resistances should be maxed out to 75%. Can recover life by life leech.
- Supply: Can recover mana quickly by mana leech.
