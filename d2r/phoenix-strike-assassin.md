# Phoenix Strike Assassin build

This is basically an officially created bug build since it is ridiculusly powerful.

## Character stats

- Strength: None.
- Dexterity: None.
- Vitality: All points.
- Energy: None.

## Skills

Add 20 points to each of the following skills:

- [Phoenix Strike](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Phoenix_Strike) (main Strike; get Charge 2).
- [Claws of Thunder](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Claws_of_Thunder) (synergy to Phoenix Strike; get Charge 3).
- [Tiger Strike](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Tiger_Strike) (synergy to Phoenix Strike; get charge 3).
- [Dragon Talon](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Talon) (main attack; final kick skill to release Phoenix Strike).
- [Fade](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Fade) (increase all resistance, reduce physical damage, reduce curse duration).

Add 1 point to each of the following skills:

- [Cobra Strike](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Cobra_Strike) (Strike for life and mana leech; get charge 3).
- [Mind Blast](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Mind_Blast) (temporarily control enemies).
- all necessary passby skills.

**Remarks**: 

1. Get 3 charges for Claws of Thunder and Cobra Strike (and Tiger Strike if wanted), then get 2 charges for Phoenix Strike. Then ready to go: attack an enemy by with Dragon Talon, teleport, then repeat.
2. The charges will expire in several seconds, so keep attacking enemies.
3. There are some time gaps for Diablo to show up after all seals are open and between Baal waves. Mind Blast may help to keep a few living enemies to kick during those gaps.
4. Activate Fade at the beginning of the game. It lasts quite long.
